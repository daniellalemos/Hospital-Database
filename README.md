# Relational Database system for scheduling exams in a clinic

Scheduling and conducting imaging exams of different modalities and types at a specific clinic.

## Contextualization

The enormous technological expansion has triggered a greater demand in the field of computer innovation by companies, thus generating increased competitiveness among them.

In this way, our work arises regarding a private clinic, which does not have an adequate database for scheduling imaging exams. This database to be created is of utmost necessity, as it will facilitate the scheduling process and streamline the entire organization process, ensuring better adherence to established schedules.
Considering the endless waiting lists for exams in the public sector, there is an urgent need to seek better alternatives, such as our clinic. However, as a consequence of this widespread adoption and influx due to the public sector's inability to respond, these events have triggered an exponential growth of the imaging exam clinic, leading to chaos.

To improve its performance, the clinic in question has decided to computerize patient data and their respective exams into a database. This initiative is due to the increased demand for the establishment, reducing time and facilitating data access, as well as assisting in the management and processing of the data in question.

Thus, the development of a database capable of aggregating all necessary information corresponding to each patient is underway.

## Goals

This practical work aims to implement a possible functional database that could be useful in an imaging exam clinic.
This database should meet all the requirements necessary for the proper scheduling and conduct of exams. Therefore, with the assistance of SQL language and modeling, the objective is to develop a viable and efficient system capable of supporting a scheduling management application in the clinic.
